    class="page2">I started played tennis in February. I have played sports growing up but I had always wanted to try tennis. I really loved it and hope to continue playing over the years.
    Although i really love it, it is very difficult and takes alot of my time away from other activites.

        This is one of my favorite tennis players, Ben Shelton, I love watching him play I think he makes matches so entertaining.
        He has amazing serves and is a very energized player.
